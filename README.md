# [Ludium] Web3 Career Pathfinder

## Overview
Ludium is a Web3 builder commutunity in Korea that provides career opportunities for builders through educaiton, contents, bounties, and grants. From the three years of serivces, we realized that the Web3 industry needs more advanced HR system in order to onbaord and retain talents. For this reason, we developed a Web3 Career Pathfinder service that assesses the builder profile to provide the most optimized task. 

## Problem

Web3 is suffering from the shortage of talent. According to the recent [statistics](https://www.developerreport.com/), there is a 56% decline in the number of new developers in the Web3 ecosystem. Although [the average salary](https://bridgeteams.com/blog/overview-of-web3-developer-salary-median-pay-bonuses-and-benefits/) is 20-40% higher than that of the conventional IT industry, new talents fail to stay for longer period of time. 

We believe that there are three systemetic problems to Web3 HR: 
1. **No Standard Track**: In the conventional world, educational institutions and corporations provide standard passage into the industry. In Web3, however, there is no established track that defines the builder's career passage. It makes it more difficult for builders to pave their own way without a proper guidance
2. **No Proof of Talent**: Conventional talent and ability is proven by the resume received from institutions such as educational degree, job title and recommendation letters. However, Web3 resume is much more diverse, consisting of project participations, hackathons, twitter posts, and etc. These records are more difficult to validate and trust
3. **No Assurance**: Regular employment is enforced by the contract to ensure the quality of work and payment. However, Web3 projects are often unprotected which leaves both the employer and employee vulnerable to the settlement issue

All these problems makes it difficult for the new comers to onboard to Web3. Even if they try out for a short while, the rate of retention falls sharply because of the lack of systematic career development.

## Solution
**(Demo Video / Screenshot)**

Ludium believe that Web3 HR can be improved thorugh the following systems:
1. **Talent Analysis**: Collect individual builder's data from diverse sources (ex. Github / LinkedIn) to analyze and assess the individual skill sets
2. **Builder Matching System**: Assign builders based on the talent analysis to the most optimized tasks. It may involve team works in which case the positions are assigned based on the requirement and individual skill sets
3. **Onchain Contract Enforcement**: Validate the work provided by the builder. For all tasks assigned, the payment amount is deposited in advance. The payment is settled when the work is validated
We belive that the system will open doors for the trust network of builders where the new way of work 

## Technical Breakdown

Ludium's pathfinder consists of three core pillars
1. **MetaID**: Onchain Self Sovereign ID(SSI) that stores builder data. It interacts with offchain data (ex. Github /LinkedIN) using Reclaim Protocol's zkTLS data entry SDK
2. **Career Management System(CMS)**: AI algorithm based engines that analyzes skill sets, assign tasks, and assess the work for verfication 
3. **Builder Contract**: Onchain contract that holds the deposits for the work order and staked token for builder voucher
